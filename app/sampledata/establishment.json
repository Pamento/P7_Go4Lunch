I guess when you are as big as they are they can do what they want as there is not really another alternative. I use their services such as maps and mail but also contribute a lot of data such as photo’s and reviews. I was under the impression that what I was doing was helping others in the community. I had not realised that google could pick and choose who used these services and can block out any one out they don’t like. I was very upset when they black baned some Chinese manufactures who are making really good products. I had also not realised that Google is a slave to any crazy president that gets into power. Anyway I will keep using  their products as they are good and hope that one day they will be available for all to use.",

The support really only consists of helping you with ad spend. Even if you attempt to start from scratch with a new listing, Google will not close an established listing and show the new one. Small businesses are becoming abused prisoners of Google. Nowadays, you cannot even get a new listing verified, the postcards do not come. Says 6 days, and we all know it's really more like 6 weeks or not at all. I manage scores of listings for clients and this is getting out of hand and there are serious issues with the platform. Guys, seriously, you have to up your game. It is no surprise that you find yourself inundated with lawsuits.",
